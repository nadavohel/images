There is no need for arguments; Arsenal’s 2-1 victory over Barcelona yesterday in the Champions League was just unfair as a wrongly disallowed goal from Lionel Messi turned the match in Arsenal’s favour.
In world football, one of the offside rule conditions is: When a player is ahead of the opposing defence but behind the ball at the time his colleague gives him possession, then the player receiving the ball is onside.
At the 37th minute of the crucial Champions League match yesterday, Barcelona were stolen a vital opportunity to go 2-0 up at the Emirates against Arsenal. The referee wrongly ruled out a clean goal by the Argentine Lionel Messi.
Opportunely, there is a convincing video evidence from 101 Great Goals, which shows the full combination of moves between Messi and Villa, leading to the cancelled goal. Watch the short, but credible highlight below:
So, just as the video evidence above ends all speculations upon the genuineness of Lionel Messi’s goal, it is clear that Referee Nicola Rizzoli’s decision turned out to be the source of Arsenal’s victory. Should Barca had been allowed to go 2-0 up deservedly in the first period, who knows what the remainder of the game would have produced?

Certainly, the Spanish titans were incorrectly denied some momentum; but conversely, it was Arsenal who were given the chance to keep believing in a comeback, since the first half only separated the two sides by a goal margin. In any case, the English giants and their fans are now celebrating one of their greatest achievements under the leadership of Arsene Wenger, while the Spanish media have already formed a huge saga of conspiracy against Barcelona—involving Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho.
