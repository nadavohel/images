The hug from the FIFA president, the celebrations in the stands and Ofir Haim's tears of happiness. The Israeli national team won an unforgettable World Cup with an unimaginable achievement: "We know how to play football." The coach was moved: "This means that Israeli players will be treated differently in Israel, they will believe in them." Hadar Fox : "No one thought we would come back with third place"
When the president of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, wore the bronze medal of the Mondialeto to the coach of the Israeli national team, Ofir Haim, tonight (between Sunday and Monday) and hugged him, the coach's tears flowed from his eyes. Rightly so. It was an emotional moment, one that closed a circle For the person responsible for the craziest year experienced by Israeli soccer, the blue-and-white team celebrated an unimaginable third place in the Under-20 World Championship, a year after being crowned European runners-up, and life has a significant part in the crazy achievement.
Along with the flags of Uruguay ( the champion ) and Italy (the runner-up), the Israeli flag was also flown at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium in La Plata. The first team since West Germany in 1987 in its debut tournament in the Mondialeto is on the podium. And all this after the impressive 1: 3 On South Korea in a game in which they came up with half the squad, but with a bunch of Weiner substitutes that did the job.
Beyond the unification of an entire country around it, only those who were present in Buenos Aires could understand how much pride Haim's team radiated to the Jews in South America. In addition, how many travelers changed their route specifically in order to be part of the history (and hysteria) of the Israeli national team.
