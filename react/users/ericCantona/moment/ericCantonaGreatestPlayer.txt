Each week four Eurosport writers make their case on a topical issue. This week: who is the greatest Premier League player of all time? Marcus Foley puts forward the case for Eric Cantona.
Cantona arrived in England the season before the formation of the Premier League, ending up at Leeds in January 1992 having been turned down by Liverpool and then rejecting Sheffield Wednesday.
During his spell at Elland Road, the Frenchman helped - but did not lead - Leeds to the First Division title. Cantona took his wares to Yorkshire owing to his pariah status in his home country following a slew of disciplinary issues, culminating in his retirement at NÃ®mes in December 1991. His talent, though was never in doubt.
Despite his on-field success, the then 26-year-old handed in a transfer request due to a deteriorating relationship with Leeds boss Howard Wilkinson, citing one of three prospective destinations: Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United.
When his move to Old Trafford finally came about in November 1992, the Red Devils, who had faltered in the previous season's title run-in, sat 10th in the table after 15 games, having drawn six and lost four averaging roughly a goal a game. Come season's end, they won the title by 10 points - their first in 26 years. Cantona had a transformative effect on United. His signing set the wheels in motion for a period of United dominance that would run for two decades.
For all his technical footballing excellence, it is perhaps the intangibles that stands Cantona apart from his contemporaries. The swagger he instilled at United and, by extension, a league, that by its own conception was an admission it had a severe and long-standing branding issue. Cantona, it can be argued, was the catalyst that changed English football, a revolutionary, whose presence set forth in motion its repositioning as a world leader. His brilliance was as symbolic as it was material.
