When Cantona collects Paul Ince's header near the halfway line, you'd want good odds of a goal coming in the next five seconds. He's got a defender inching closer to him and there are enough bodies behind the ball to buy QPR the time they need to avoid disaster. But then everything changes...

The first man is beaten with the old schoolyard trick of just knocking it past someone and then running around the other side. The pace Cantona advances with suddenly turns this situation desperate for Rangers' players. They don't know whether to stick with Hughes and Giggs or shut the Frenchman down. He mercifully ends the tortune quickly, ignoring passing options to simply arrow a shot into the corner. You could try and replicate that move a trillion times and never manage it so effortlessly.
