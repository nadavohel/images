This morning Haim Rabivo became the second Israeli footballer to play in Turkey, after signing a three-season contract with Fenerbahce. Ronan Harazi previously played for Bursaspor for a short time.
Tonight the deal worth 7 million dollars was completed. A night meeting between the representatives of Celta Vigo and Fenerbahce resulted in Rabivo leaving the Spanish league after three years. As part of the deal, Rabivo will receive a salary of 5 million dollars in three seasons.
The Turkish fans have already announced that if he signs, they will give him a very warm welcome, already at the airport.
