The replay of the 1998–99 FA Cup semi-final between Arsenal and Manchester United was a football match that took place at Villa Park in Birmingham, England, on 14 April 1999.
David Beckham scored an early goal for Manchester United, with Dennis Bergkamp equalising in the second half. Roy Keane, United's captain, was sent off, and Peter Schmeichel saved a Bergkamp penalty kick to send the game to extra time. Ryan Giggs scored a goal in extra time to give United a 2–1 victory and send them through to the 1999 FA Cup final.
The game is often described as one of Manchester United's greatest ever, and Giggs' winning goal is frequently cited as one of the greatest goals ever scored in English football. Rob Smyth of The Guardian described it as "the greatest game in the modern era of English football. […] this match […] had such gravitas, subtlety, intensity and excellence that it should have been shown on HBO.)"
