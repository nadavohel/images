Once again, a foundation of success was slowly growing, though, and the 2006-07 campaign brought a ninth Premier League title before a 10th followed 12 months later.

The major achievement of 2008, though, was a second Champions League success. After drawing 1-1 with Chelsea at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, the match went to penalties, with United coming back from the dead in the shootout as John Terry slipped while taking a kick that would have won the Blues the trophy.

While they continued to dominate domestically, further European success would elude them as Barcelona’s era of comparative Champions League dominance began by beating United 2-0 in the 2009 showpiece in Rome. They would subsequently lose to Barca again in the 2011 fixture at Wembley.

A landmark 19th title had preceded that match, which was Ferguson’s 12th personally. It made the Red Devils the most successful club in the history of the English top flight, symbolically overtaking Liverpool.

Number 20 arrived two years later, with the title sealed with four matches to spare. It was overshadowed, however, by Ferguson’s announcement that he was to retire from his post.

His final match in charge, his 1500th in total, was against West Brom and finished in an incredible 5-5 draw – a fitting finale given the excitement he had brought to the club throughout the years.

In the 2012-13 campaign, he was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Season gong for the 11th time in his career, having also won the UEFA Manager of the Year award in 1998-99.
