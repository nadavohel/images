as part of the 1994 world cup qualifiers, the israeli national team was hosted against the french national team in october 1993. it should be noted that the israeli national team previously played in a game held in israel and the blue-white team was defeated 4:0, so few believed that it was possible to get a good result on the hard court in the french capital. but it happened, in one of the team's greatest games of all time, with a tremendous 2:3 at the last moment that also caused the late meir einstein to lose his voice from excitement - meir calm down.
