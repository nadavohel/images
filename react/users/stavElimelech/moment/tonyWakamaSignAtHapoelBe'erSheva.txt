On the other hand, the goalkeeper Austin Ajida and the stopper Tomislav Pajovic were released. Goalkeeper M.S. Ashdod in the past season Ofir Marciano is the leading candidate to be the first goalkeeper of the team from the capital of the Negev next season.
Apart from Wakama, Hapoel Be'er Sheva announced the signing of the defender Matan Ohion who will play in the capital of the Negev for the next two years. Ohion, who started the season in Maccabi Haifa and later moved to Hapoel Tel Aviv, will undergo medical tests tomorrow with Barak Becher's team, after which he will sign the contract.
On the other hand, the contacts with Dubev Gabbai are stuck. Gabbai ended a four-year contract in Be'er Sheva and it is still not clear whether he will continue for a fifth season. He is currently on a private vacation in the United States.
