9.5.1998. The final cycle of the 97/98 season, Hapoel Beer Sheva at the end of a nightmarish season knows that it must win. On the other side, how ironic, was Maccabi Haifa (which will appear in the parade), which ended the season. The team from the capital of the Negev is in the midst of a struggle for survival, in complete collapse after winning the state cup only a year before. And among the odd group of players that gathered on the dusty field in Wassermil, there was Benion: a prospect, then only 18 years old, but already one who excited quite a few people. A bright spot in a rather dark season for Beer Sheva. In the ninetieth minute, a penalty was whistled, and who if not.
Benion There. He subdued Nir Davidovich and ran to celebrate, but then he received the news from the stands - Bnei Yehuda won, and his team was relegated to the National League. From here, the image was created that will forever be etched in the memory. Benion had many tears of happiness throughout his career, but the moment he entered the living room All of us had rather tears of sorrow. The pain of a child who experienced his first sports scar, at such a young age. Both he and Beer Sheva will close a circle from this black moment, but this image will be difficult to erase. Watch the dramatic moment.
