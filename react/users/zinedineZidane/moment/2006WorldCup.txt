Zidane had, in fact, retired from the international scene two years prior, but his services were once again required as the national team came calling. Some were joyous, while others questioned the decision to bring back a 34-year-old who was set to hang up his boots in the not-too-distant future.
However, Zidane was still at his supreme best, picking up the Player of the Tournament award. 
Of course, Zizou's 2006 World Cup will primarily be remembered for that headbutt, which saw him sent off in the final. And while that was a pretty impressive connection, it was his performances throughout the tournament that should be remembered and spoken about instead.
The dazzling Frenchman came back from suspension to grab an assist and score in the round of 16 clash with Spain, setting up a tussle with Brazil in the next round. 
Zidane ran the show.
Zizou was as elegant as ever, pirouetting his way around his opponents and plucking balls out of the sky effortlessly. This was, of course, mixed with the perfect amount of aggression and physicality, easing his opponents off the ball before humiliating them with a piece of skill. He also assisted the winning goal. 
It ended in despair, but this shouldn't take away from his sheer excellence.
