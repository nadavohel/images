Zidane's performance against Ajax in the 1997 Champions League semi-final for â€‹Juventus was simply sublime. The Bianconeri came into the clash holding a 2-1 lead from the first leg, but an inch-perfect corner from Zidane was headed home after 34 minutes by Attilio Lombardo to extend their lead. 
Juve quickly made it 2-0 on the night before Ajax pulled one back. However, the ever-elegant Frenchman worked his magic once more. With the ball stuck to his feet, he glided past his opponent and burst into the box. And time seemingly stood still as he casually waited...and waited...for the perfect moment before cutting the ball back for Nicola Amoruso to tap in. 
Two assists and a generally world class display, nutmegging and flicking the ball past his opponents who hadn't a clue how to stop him. To cap off the display, he got himself on the score sheet, taking the ball round the goalkeeper and slotting home. Composure personified.
