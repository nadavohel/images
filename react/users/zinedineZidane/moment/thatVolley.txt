Arguably the greatest goal to have ever been scored in the Champions League. 
In Zidane's first season with â€‹Real Madrid, he completed the set as he finally got his hands on the Champions League crown. Los Blancos were drawing 1-1 with Bayer Leverkusen in the final, and were in need of someone to produce a moment of magic.
Zidane provided it - and then some.
A cross from Roberto Carlos looped up into the air, and it seemingly took an age before the Frenchman's left boot connected perfectly. The technique to allow the ball to drop and strike it with his 'weaker foot' into the top corner was nothing short of phenomenal. Goalkeeper had no chance. 
Not a bad way to score the winning goal in the Champions League. Not bad at all.
